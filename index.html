 Hi, I might be too late, I might be, all I can say is that, I want you to get back onto me, I know its my damn fault, so please, give a chance where I can correct my mistakes. I know your tired, but will I know what is your answer? the days I have been isolated, gives me a lot of time to think . Please, let me get you back, I want the you, I will become the best of me to not you worry about, so please let me get back to your arms. My grammar is not that great, you know it, but all I want is my message for you to read. I'm changing not just because of that mistake that cause you a lot of pain but for the better version of me, clinging to your arms and maturing. I want to fulfil the promises that we talked about or even dreamed about, I want to spend my life with you. I will do my best to become yours again. 
  </p>

  I'm deeply and genuinely sorry for my mistakes, and sorry for the things that I've did, sorry for letting you felt that. I know I promise this before but this time ill do even better me. It hurts when your not on my side, It hurts when we dont have any conversation, Ithurts when everything was all at my fault. it hurts, sorry love. I miss you so much. I truly miss you to the point that everyday I watched our vids, browsing my gallery and my telegram because i miss you, You may know me so well, but promise I try to change myself.
