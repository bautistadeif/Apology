    <p>
  I'm deeply and genuinely sorry for all the mistakes I’ve made. I'm sorry for the pain I caused, for making you feel unappreciated, and for letting things get to the point where you were hurt. I know I’ve said sorry before, but this time, I truly mean it from the bottom of my heart. I’ve had time to reflect while being alone, and it hurts so much knowing that I was the reason things fell apart. I take full responsibility, and I regret everything that made you feel unloved, unheard, or unimportant. I’m sorry for not being better when you needed me to be. I miss you every day, and it breaks me not having you by my side.
  </p>

  I want you back, not just to fix what was broken, but to build something even stronger. I’m working on myself, not just for you, but for us and the future we once dreamed about. I still want that future with you. I want to keep the promises we made, and make new ones that I’ll live up to. I want to be someone who makes you feel safe, loved, and supported every single day. I’ll do everything I can to earn your trust again. Please, give me a chance to show you that I can be better, that I am better. I love you, and I want nothing more than to be in your arms again.
